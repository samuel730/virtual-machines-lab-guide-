## Introduction

In this lab, we explored the process of creating and managing virtual machines using Vagrant in combination with VirtualBox. Vagrant is a powerful tool in DevOps that allows developers to automate the setup of development environments, ensuring consistency across multiple machines.

The main objectives of this lab were to:

1. Install and configure Vagrant and VirtualBox on a Windows machine.

2. Initialize a Vagrant project and create a virtual machine using a pre-configured Ubuntu box.

3. Provision the virtual machine automatically with the Apache web server.

4. Access the virtual machine via SSH and test the web server functionality.

5. Manage the VM lifecycle, including starting, stopping, and destroying the VM.

By completing this lab, we gained hands-on experience in setting up isolated, reproducible environments — a core practice in DevOps for development, testing, and deployment automation. This exercise provides a foundational understanding of how virtual machines and provisioning tools work together to streamline software development workflows.
